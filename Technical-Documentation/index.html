            <p><em>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</em> As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_HTML">
            <header><h1>What is HTML</h1></header>
            <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
            </pre>
            <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_HTML_Element">
            <header><h1>Anatomy of HTML Element</h1></header>
            <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="visual representation of how html tags work">
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
                <li><b>The content</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                <li><b>The element:</b>  The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="visual representation of second html tag">
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things. Some attributes have no value, such as required.</p>
            <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
                <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_Elements">
            <header><h1>Nesting Elements</h1></header>
        <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a strong element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the p element first, then the strong element; therefore, we have to close the strong element first, then the p element. The following is incorrect:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Void_Elements">
        <header><h1>Void Elements</h1></header>
        <p>Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the img element that we already have in our HTML page:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>&lt;img src=&quot;images/firefox-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;My test image&quot; /&gt;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing </img> tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Images">
        <header><h1>Images</h1></header>
        <p>Let's turn our attention to the img element again:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>&lt;img src=&quot;images/firefox-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;My test image&quot; /&gt;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
        <p>We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p>
        <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Marking_up_text">
        <header><h1>Marking up text</h1></header>
        <p>This section will cover some essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
        <h3>Headings</h3>
        <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, h1 - h6, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
        <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
        <p>As explained above,p elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:</p>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Links">
        <header><h1>Links</h1></header>
        <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web!</p>
        <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
