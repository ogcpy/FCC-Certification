            <h2>Here is a Timeline of Steve Jobs' life:</h2>
            <ul id="timeline">
                <li><span id="years">His Early Childhood Days - 1955</span><br>
                    Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, to parents Joanne Simpson and Abdulfattah Jandali. He was later adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs with whom he moved to Mountain View, California.<br>
                    As a child, Jobs was interested in engineering and electronics and took apart various items to see how they worked. He later attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California.</li>
                <li><span id="years">A Chance Internship at HP - 1968</span><br>
                    As a continuation of his interest in electronics, Steve Jobs called up Bill Hewlett, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, in search of spare parts to build a frequency counter. Impressed by Jobs’ attention to detail, he was granted the parts as well as an internship for the summer.</li>
                <li><span id="years">An Eventful College Life – 1970 to 1972</span><br>
                    In the early part of 1970, Jobs’ meets the future Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, through a mutual friend and the two get along quite well despite their four-year age difference.<br>
                    In 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. However, he dropped out after one semester as he felt that he was not getting anything out of it. Although, Steve Jobs did continue auditing calligraphy classes at Reed College which kept him interested.</li>
                <li><span id="years">Steve Jobs’ foray into big things – 1974</span><br>
                    Steve Jobs then returned to California and began a brief stint as a technician at Atari, a video game manufacturer. While here, Jobs’ gets in touch with Wozniak and enlists his help in deciding on the hardware required for the prototype for a single-player game called Pong, which would later be known as Breakout.<br>
                    In the summer of 1974, Jobs traveled to India with a friend to visit ashrams and experience Buddhism. Upon his return to the US, he began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club with Steve Wozniak.</li>
                <li><span id="years">The Rise of Apple Computer Inc.- 1976</span><br>
                    Wozniak had designed and built his own computer-cum-logic board which he called the Apple I. With Jobs’ help, they founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) in 1976 and released their first product, the Apple I, later that year.<br>
                    Apple’s third founder, Ronald Wayne, served as the group’s adult supervisor, drawing up the Apple logo, the partnership agreement, and the manual for Apple I. Afraid of the financial risks, Ronald Wayne gave up his shares for a sum of $2,300 but the Apple I went on to sell for $666.66 a piece by the end of the year.</li>
                <li><span id="years">The Beginning of a Successful Streak – 1977</span><br>
                On January 3, 1977, Apple gets incorporated as an official company , supported by a group of venture capitalists. The company’s second product, the Apple II, plastic encased with color graphics, was released in 1977 and became one of the first commercially successful personal computers. Sales naturally hit more than $1 Million per year!

                <li><span id="years">The Birth of Lisa – 1978</span><br>
                    Steve Job gets blessed with a daughter named Lisa, with then-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan, whom he initially denied paternity. Chrisann raises Lisa on welfare funds during which it takes time for Jobs’ to acknowledge paternity towards his child. He would later name the Apple computer Lisa in his daughter’s name.</li>
                <li><span id="years">An Insanely Great Ambition – 1979</span>While a lot was happening on the Apple front, Steve Jobs along with a few Apple engineers decide to head to a tech demonstration at Xerox Corp’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) where the introduction of new technology, the GUI (Graphical User Interface) was making waves.<br>
                Jobs and his colleagues were granted three-day access to the PARC facilities by Xerox on the condition that they are allowed to purchase stocks, a total of 100,000 Apple shares, at a pre-IPO price of $10 per share.</li>
                <li><span id="years">Apple Goes Public – 1980</span><br>
                    On December 12, 1980, Apple went public and in just its initial public stock offering, managed to raise $110 million, more capital than any IPO since Ford in 1956! They made history that day, creating more millionaires than any other public offering had ever created before.</li>
                <li><span id="years">Apple Lisa and Its Eventual Failure- 1981</span><br>
                In 1981, Apple released the Lisa computer which was the first personal computer to offer a graphical user interface (GUI). Also, it was around this time that Jobs began working on a smaller lower-cost computer after a brief scuttle and infighting concerning the Lisa computer.</li>
                <li><span id="years">Apple Gets a New CEO – 1983</span><br>
                After having made a grand entry into the Fortune 500 list of top companies in America, Apple got itself a new Chief Executive Officer in John Sculley, skillfully recruited by Steve jobs. Sculley was the then acting president of PepsiCo, Inc. and was whisked away by a shrewd comment by Steve, “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life?”
                </li>
                <li><span id="years">Macintosh Surfaces – 1984</span><br>
                In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh which featured a GUI that was based on Xerox’s Star system. The Macintosh was unsuccessful initially but went on to become one of the most popular personal computers of all time.<br>
                Steve Jobs himself unveiled and introduced the Macintosh during the SuperBowl XVIII through the now famous $1.5 Million TV commercial directed by Ridley Scott and known today as a masterpiece of marketing.

                <li><span id="years">The Power Struggle and Steve Jobs’ Ousting From Apple – 1985</span><br>
                    The conception of the Macintosh made Jobs’ uncompromising nature quite evident, from the design creation to its eventual launch. The resulting disagreements kept festering within the company and concerned Apple employees finally resulting in an open power struggle between Steve Jobs and Apple CEO John Sculley.<br>

                    While the board of directors wanted Sculley to contain Steve and let not his ventures result in expensive forays, Steve jobs instead planned to oust Sculley from his position. When Sculley caught wind of this scheme, he colluded with the stakeholders and finally succeeded in removing Jobs’ from his managerial position.<br>
                    
                    Jobs then resigned from Apple and sold all but one Apple stock. Steve Wozniak also followed suit by de facto resigning from his high position and getting back to the Apple product development team to be more involved in the making than simply reigning.</li>
                <li><span id="years">Steve Jobs Tryst with NeXT and Pixar Animation Studios – 1986</span><br>
                    After Apple, Jobs’ then founded NeXT Inc., a computer company that specialized in workstations for universities and businesses; however, NeXT failed to gain traction in the marketplace.<br>

                    The NeXT computer was funded by a Japanese electronics company and was noted for its engineering design. However, it was a costly venture and was eventually eclipsed by more cost-effective competitor products.<br>
                    
                    Soon after, Jobs purchased The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm Ltd., for $5 million. Over the next 15 years, Pixar Animation Studios released some of the most successful animated films of all time including Toy Story (1995), A Bug’s Life (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monsters Inc.(2001), Finding Nemo (2003), and more.</li>
                <li><span id="years">The Journey of NeXT and Apple continues – 1987 to 1995</span><br>
                    In late 1988, NeXT released its first NeXT computer with a tag of $6,500 a piece. It was received as largely cost-prohibitive due to its advanced workstation, but those who could afford it became its staunch supporters.<br>

                    Steve Jobs managed to market the NeXT products to scientific and academic sponsors due to the innovative technologies incorporated in its production like the built-in Ethernet Port, Mach Kernel, and the digital signal processor chip.<br>

                    After a while, Jobs’ shifted his focus from developing whole computers to largely dealing with software at NeXT.

                    Meanwhile, in 1991, IBM Corp. and Apple ally to develop advanced software and new PC microprocessors. Apple’s PowerBook gets launched, establishing the standard norm for future laptop computers.<br>

                    1993 saw the introduction of Apple’s pen-based computer, Newton. And although it was a huge financial disappointment when launched, it nevertheless paved the way for Apple’s products like the iPhone and iPad in the future.<br>

                    A string of financial failures saw Apple changing hands from CEO John Sculley to president Michael Spindler. Then in 1994, Apple introduces the Power Macintosh Computers and decides to license its OS, thereby allowing its competitors to clone the Mac.

                <li><span id="years">Back to Apple – 1996</span>The administration of Apple changes hands again, from Michael Spindler to Gil Amelio on February 2, 1996. After a thorough briefing on the admin management, Amelio learned that even prolonged efforts could not develop or produce an alternate for the aging Macintosh OS. Instead, he chose to purchase NeXT for $430 Million for the NeXTstep OS that Jobs’ and his team had developed.<br>

                    This decision resulted in Jobs returning to Apple’s management while also laying the base for NeXT technology to become the foundation of the Mac OS X operating system.

                <li><span id="years">An Interim Consultant for Apple – 1997</span><br>
                    When the board of directors at Apple were dissatisfied with Amelio’s capabilities to make Apple financially stable, they turned to Steve Jobs for help. As the interim CEO of Apple, Steve Jobs first scrapped the contracts of cloning the Mac technology and announced Apple’s partnership with Microsoft.</li>

His drastic weight loss started raising public concerns which amounted to a simple common bug and hormonal imbalance issues. A few days after Steve Jobs declared he was fit to continue working, he took a few days off for a medical leave. It was later learned that Steve Jobs had undergone a liver transplant at the Methodist University Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.</li>
